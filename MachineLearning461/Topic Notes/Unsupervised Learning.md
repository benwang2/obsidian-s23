Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the goal is to identify patterns or structure in unlabeled data. In unsupervised learning, there is no known output variable or target value that the model is trying to predict. Instead, the algorithm must discover the underlying structure or relationships within the data.

## Clustering

Unsupervised learning is capable of 'clustering' data to reveal hidden structures in the data.

To accomplish this, there are multiple different methods:
- k-means clustering
- hierarchical clustering
