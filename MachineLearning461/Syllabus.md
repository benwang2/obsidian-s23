**Instructor**: Qiong Zhang  
**Meeting location**: SEC 205  
**Prerequisites**: M 250 (Introductory Linear Algebra), CS 112 (Data Structures), CS 206 (Introduction to Discrete Structures II) OR M 477 (Mathematical Theory of Probability) OR S 379 (Basic Probability Theory)  
**Meeting Times**: M/H 10:20am-11:40am

**Course Description**

This course is a systematic introduction to machine learning, covering theoretical as well as practical aspects of the use of statistical methods. Topics include linear models for classification and regression, support vector machines, regularization and model selection, and introduction to deep learning. Machine learning is a vast, fast-changing field. The course is designed to provide a solid starting point by focusing on technical foundations. Students will learn fundamental concepts in the field such as generalization and model selection. Students will also learn how to implement key techniques in the field from scratch including gradient descent, kernel trick, boosting, and expectation maximization. The course content will be delivered by a combination of written assignments that require rigorous proofs and self-contained Python Juypter Notebooks that require completing missing portions and empirically investigating the behavior of models on datasets. The course will reinforce learning with a series of short quizzes throughout the semester. The course content is designed to be accessible to all SAS students regardless of their majors who have an adequate background in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and programming.

**Learning Objectives**

The course objectives are: (1) understanding the goals, capabilities, and principles of machine learning, (2) acquiring mathematical tools to formalize machine learning problems, and (3) acquiring implementation skills to build practical machine learning systems. At the end of the course, students will have the knowledge of core machine learning techniques, so that they can use them to solve real-world prediction problems using basic Python and a small set of libraries. The knowledge they acquire in this course will directly transfer to any future courses they may take that go deeper into specific application areas of machine learning.

**Text/Resources**

There is no required text. Lecture slides are self-contained. To augment lectures, there will be optional reading from publicly available online textbooks such as:

[Machine Learning, (Tom Mitchell, 1997)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/files/MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf)

[Links to an external site.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/files/MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf)  
[Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Murphy, 2012)](https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20Learning_%20A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective%20%5BMurphy%202012-08-24%5D.pdf)

There will also be suggested reading from other publicly available technical notes written by various instructors/researchers.

 **Coursework Requirements**

To assess that students have acquired basic literacy in all the concepts, tools, and techniques they are taught, they will be given 3 quizzes (each 15%) periodically throughout the semester.

There will be five assignments (each 10%). The assignments are designed to be challenging but rewarding. Collaboration is allowed and encouraged as long as students (1) write their own solutions entirely on their own, (2) specify names of student(s) they collaborated with in their writeups, and (3) specify the part(s) of the question collaborated on. The students will need to digest and reformulate the lecture content in order to successfully complete the assignments. Discussion about assignment problems on Canvas is encouraged but no direct answers should be shared. 

Students are expected to attend all classes and take notes on the most basic and important concepts discussed in each class. There will be ten in-class surveys distributed randomly across the semester (each 0.5%). They consist of short true and false questions which serve as attendance and attention check for that class.

**Academic Integrity Policies**

Rutgers University regards acts of dishonesty (e.g. plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. These policies are detailed here:

[https://nbprovost.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity-students](https://nbprovost.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity-students)

[Links to an external site.](https://nbprovost.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity-students)

In addition, the Computer Science departments has established policies for academic integrity that pertain specifically to programming assignments:

**Late Assignment Policies**

You receive 8 total grace days for use on any homework assignment. We will keep track of them. No assignment will be accepted more than 3 days after the deadline or once the grace days run out.

In general, we do not grant extensions on assignments. There are several exceptions:

Medical Emergencies: For minor illnesses, we expect grace days or our late penalties to provide sufficient accommodation. For medical emergencies (e.g. prolonged hospitalization), students may request an extension afterwards and should include a doctor’s note.  
Family/Personal Emergencies: If you have a family emergency (e.g. death in the family) or a personal emergency (e.g. mental health crisis), please contact your academic adviser or Counseling Services. In addition to offering support, they will reach out to the instructors for all your courses on your behalf to request an extension.

The email should be sent as soon as you are aware of the conflict and at least 5 days prior to the deadline. In the case of an emergency, no notice is needed.
