## Recursive Descent Parsing

Recursive descent is one of the simplest parsing techniques and is used in practical compilres.
- Each non-terminal has an associated **parsing procedure** that an recognize any sequence of tokens generated by thta non-terminal
- There is a **main** routine to initialize all **globals** (e.g: **token**) and call the start symbol. On return, check whether **token == eof**, and whether errors occurred. (Note: left-to-right evaluation of expressions)
- Within a parsing procedure, both non-terminals and terminals can be "matched"
	- Non-terminal $A$ - call parsing procedure for A
	- token $t$ - compare $t$ with current input token; if mtach, consume input, otherwise **ERROR**
- Parsing procedures may contain code that performs some useful "computation" (syntax directed translation)
